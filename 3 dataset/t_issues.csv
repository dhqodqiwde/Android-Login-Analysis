While the stacktrace is the same, I think this is a completely different issue than #549. Basically, our fragments stay alive beyond the activity lifecycle so that we can keep logging the user in even if they rotate the screen. This gets a little messy though because we could be trying to finish the activity while it's in no-man's land between an onDestroy and an onCreate. My guess is that since the phone you mentioned is older and slower, it takes much longer for the activity to recreate and attach itself to our fragments thus increasing the likelihood of a crash.

I.e. in most cases, the UI thread. This would in turn cause an android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException exception, which was swallowed by OS and it would retry every 10 seconds.

This was especially problematic for apps re-opening with an already logged-in user, as the access token needed to be refreshed to start sync. This would effectively block Realms from being opened, making the app appear deadlocked. The only solution was logging out and back again.","In order to fix this, I turned the NetworkTransport Async, so it now uses an internal handler thread to run all network requests. This means that no matter how a network request is started, it will always run on a worker-tread. This causes a little bit of overhead, but given that a network request is already pretty slow, this seems acceptable."

According to #1163 (comment):

Set upper range for FB Login SDK to >=13.1.0 <14.0.0 in this PR
Merge this PR with a major version increase, as it may be a breaking change. The FB Login SDK is currently added as api, so it can transitively accessed if the developer adds the Parse SDK also as api to their app. Since the FB SDK has some braking changes with 13.x, we need to consider that also a breaking change for the Parse SDK.

The problem was that sometimes (not sure what it depends on) the list in the third step doesn't contain the newly created client. And if there is no other client (with a different name) to fall back to, the autofill fails.
To work around it I added a 1-second pause before the third step. I think this should do it.
There was also a 3+ years old TODO to use the creation result in step 2 (it contains credentials for the created client). I implemented this part, so it should be a little more optimized now.

This, for sure, fixes another bug, though. The issue comes from the fact that the site URL stored in the app prefs is not deleted in some cases, and that's why the entered URL used later on is the ""current site"" URL, which leads to the different broken states.

To reproduce the bug

Open a clean app
Log in -> Enter a non WP.com site
Go back to the main screen
Create a new store -> login
Enter wp.com email
Notice that ""it looks like is connected to a different wp.com account"" error
My not proven theory is that in some cases, if the site entered on step 2 matches the wpcom account, but somehow not wpcom then JP activation flow started and crash happens, because URL from another site is used that we don't have credentials"

This PR doesn't implement an optimal fix as it'd be quite complex and is imo not worth the time at the moment. It seems to me the app misuses theFLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK -> at least I don't see any reason why we'd need this flag in our app.

The ideal fix imo would be to remove the usage of FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK from all the places and rely on the default Android behavior + ensure MainActivity isn't recreated when it's already at the top of the stack.

Either case, this PR only updates the latter part of the code and ensures the MainActivity is not recreated when it's already at the top. This fixes the original issue where the MainActivity used to redirect the user to MyStore screen when it was originally not launched from the OS Launcher but for example from the Login Flow."
