Then, I have to tap on the desired account once for each instance, as they disappear one by one, and after the last one, app crashes:","I can't reproduce this, but I know it's happened to me too a few times before. While the stacktrace is the same, I think this is a completely different issue than #549. Basically, our fragments stay alive beyond the activity lifecycle so that we can keep logging the user in even if they rotate the screen. This gets a little messy though because we could be trying to finish the activity while it's in no-man's land between an onDestroy and an onCreate. My guess is that since the phone you mentioned is older and slower, it takes much longer for the activity to recreate and attach itself to our fragments thus increasing the likelihood of a crash. Anyway, hopefully #618 will fix this kind of issue once and for all."
