Setup server to use public key and password for ssh auth
Add server info on git server settings (I can't choose both SSH key and password, so I marked SSH key)
Try to sync the repo
See error
Expected behavior
Sync passwords","Add support for multiple authentication methods by offering password authentication after public key authentication.

Along the way, refactor GitOperation to use a (somewhat) proper builder
pattern. This uncovered that we were previously not using SSHJ for the
case of no authentication, which is now rectified.

This, for sure, fixes another bug, though. The issue comes from the fact that the site URL stored in the app prefs is not deleted in some cases, and that's why the entered URL used later on is the ""current site"" URL, which leads to the different broken states.

To reproduce the bug

Open a clean app
Log in -> Enter a non WP.com site
Go back to the main screen
Create a new store -> login
Enter wp.com email
Notice that ""it looks like is connected to a different wp.com account"" error
My not proven theory is that in some cases, if the site entered on step 2 matches the wpcom account, but somehow not wpcom then JP activation flow started and crash happens, because URL from another site is used that we don't have credentials",,Improper Error State Handling,Authentication Failures,Specific Input

While the stacktrace is the same, I think this is a completely different issue than #549. Basically, our fragments stay alive beyond the activity lifecycle so that we can keep logging the user in even if they rotate the screen. This gets a little messy though because we could be trying to finish the activity while it's in no-man's land between an onDestroy and an onCreate.
