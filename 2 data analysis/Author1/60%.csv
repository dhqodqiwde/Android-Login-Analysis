According to #1163 (comment):

Set upper range for FB Login SDK to >=13.1.0 <14.0.0 in this PR
Merge this PR with a major version increase, as it may be a breaking change. The FB Login SDK is currently added as api, so it can transitively accessed if the developer adds the Parse SDK also as api to their app. Since the FB SDK has some braking changes with 13.x, we need to consider that also a breaking change for the Parse SDK.

This, for sure, fixes another bug, though. The issue comes from the fact that the site URL stored in the app prefs is not deleted in some cases, and that's why the entered URL used later on is the ""current site"" URL, which leads to the different broken states.

To reproduce the bug

Open a clean app
Log in -> Enter a non WP.com site
Go back to the main screen
Create a new store -> login
Enter wp.com email
Notice that ""it looks like is connected to a different wp.com account"" error
My not proven theory is that in some cases, if the site entered on step 2 matches the wpcom account, but somehow not wpcom then JP activation flow started and crash happens, because URL from another site is used that we don't have credentials",Improper Error State Handling,Authentication Failures,Specific login approach

This PR doesn't implement an optimal fix as it'd be quite complex and is imo not worth the time at the moment. It seems to me the app misuses theFLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK -> at least I don't see any reason why we'd need this flag in our app.

The ideal fix imo would be to remove the usage of FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK from all the places and rely on the default Android behavior + ensure MainActivity isn't recreated when it's already at the top of the stack.

Either case, this PR only updates the latter part of the code and ensures the MainActivity is not recreated when it's already at the top.
