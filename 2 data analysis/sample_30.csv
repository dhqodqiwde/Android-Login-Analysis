I haven't been able to reproduce the issue but it looks like we set the mSiteAddressInput=null when the fragment is destroyed. So if the onTextChanged is called before the mSiteAddressInput could be initialised again, this crash could potentially happen.

Given that we needn't update the mSiteAddressInput field after the fragment is destroyed, it seemed enough to do just a null check here to ensure that this crash doesn't happen again.

The Login Discovery Error view was missed during the first round of changes and since it's difficult to get it to be shown, it wasn't failing during testing. The bug is the duplicated +id/toolbar ID assigned in fragment_login_discovery_error.xml layout. When the login library was updated, the toolbar was placed inside an AppBarLayout so using that ID in the <include/> element was erroneously attempting to assign that id to an AppBarLayout instead of a Toolbar and that was causing the crash."

This, for sure, fixes another bug, though. The issue comes from the fact that the site URL stored in the app prefs is not deleted in some cases, and that's why the entered URL used later on is the ""current site"" URL, which leads to the different broken states.

To reproduce the bug

Open a clean app
Log in -> Enter a non WP.com site
Go back to the main screen
Create a new store -> login
Enter wp.com email
Notice that ""it looks like is connected to a different wp.com account"" error
My not proven theory is that in some cases, if the site entered on step 2 matches the wpcom account, but somehow not wpcom then JP activation flow started and crash happens, because URL from another site is used that we don't have credentials"

While the stacktrace is the same, I think this is a completely different issue than #549. Basically, our fragments stay alive beyond the activity lifecycle so that we can keep logging the user in even if they rotate the screen. This gets a little messy though because we could be trying to finish the activity while it's in no-man's land between an onDestroy and an onCreate. My guess is that since the phone you mentioned is older and slower, it takes much longer for the activity to recreate and attach itself to our fragments thus increasing the likelihood of a crash. Anyway, hopefully #618 will fix this kind of issue once and for all."
